# BST-Book-Analyser
A BST (Binary Search Tree) based book Analyser. It can sort the words in the books as per their frequency count or as per their lexographical order. I Created a templated BST from scratch and used it as the base data structure to store words and word frequencies in a different special object. I used OOPs principles to design this.
